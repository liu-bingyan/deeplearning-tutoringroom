So, I thought I\u2019d outsmart him. I filled the bathtub with toys instead of water to lure him. As soon as he cautiously crept out, he jumped straight into the tub, only to realize it was just a trap! He leaped out again, this time knocking over a plant in his escape.

It explores themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and empathy through the eyes of Scout as she witnesses her father, Atticus Finch, defend a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman. This book resonates with me because it challenges societal norms and encourages readers to stand up for what is right, regardless of the consequences.
